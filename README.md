 - owner: he is able to create new properties and edit his owns, who already exist in the app

At the start of the app the user is able to see the landing page who presents two distinct buttons: Login and Sign Up. If he doesn't have an account he create one and after that he should login to be able to reach the home page with all the properties available in the Adventuro platform.
